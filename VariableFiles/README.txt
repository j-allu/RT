This directory introduces variable files.

- `simple.py` is a very simple variable file containing variables directly
  as attributes.

- `dynamic.py` demonstrates having a function that returns variables.

- `tests.robot` uses the aforementioned variable files.

In addition to importing variable files using the `Variables` setting, they can
also be taken into use from the command line using the `--variablefile` option.
