This directory demonstrates modifying tests and results using model modifiers
and otherwise.

Using model modifiers is explained in the Robot Framework User Guide:
http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#programmatic-modification-of-test-data

Robot Framework's API used by the model modifiers is documented at
http://robot-framework.readthedocs.org/.
